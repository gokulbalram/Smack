I work in an environment where we have a good mix of MacOS and Windows devices, and I am tired of not having airdrop, or having to tell my coworkers which exact folder I pasted my stuff in on the server, so here is this ChatGPT shitshow 

I aim to do the following:
- Easy sharing through Right click context menus (no idea how this works in Mac OS)
- Usernames for ease of use
- Some basic GUI, while keeping intrusion to minimum, run in the background kinda deal
